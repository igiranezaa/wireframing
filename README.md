## Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes focus on the basic structure and functionality of a website or application. The key elements include:

- **Layout Structure:**  
  Defines the arrangement of elements on a page. A clear layout ensures users can easily navigate and find information.  
  *Example:* Placing the search bar at the top of a booking website allows users to quickly start searching for properties.

- **Navigation:**  
  Shows how users move through the site or app. Proper navigation improves usability and ensures users can reach their goals efficiently.  
  *Example:* A sidebar menu for filtering hotel listings helps users refine results without leaving the page.

- **Content Placement:**  
  Indicates where text, images, buttons, and other content will appear. Organized content placement improves readability and engagement.  
  *Example:* Highlighting featured hotels at the top of a page draws usersâ€™ attention to popular options.

- **Functionality:**  
  Outlines key interactions and features of the system. Clearly defining functionality ensures that essential tasks can be performed smoothly.  
  *Example:* A "Book Now" button on a hotel listing allows users to complete reservations directly from the listing page.
